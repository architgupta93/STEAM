- run RUNME.m in matlab to see plots of the functions below

- note: the two basic functions smoothabs and safeexp
  - everything else is derived from these two (currently, all are derived
    from smoothabs)

- utility functions:
  - smoothabs, dsmoothabs, ddsmoothabs
    - try using a Gaussian as the base, rather than sqrt
      - might have much stronger damping properties, making
	d/dx(x*d/dx(smoothabs(x))) monotonic
	     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	     this itself is another smoothabs(x)
	- need to understand this precisely
      - currently: smoothabs(x,s) = sqrt(x^2 + s)
      - how about sqrt(-log(e^(-x^2 + s)))?
        - probably won't do much good
      - intuitively: if we can make d/dx(smoothabs(x)) decay faster than
        any polynomial of x - maybe somehow like a Gaussian, then it might be
	good - suggest use erfc(x) for smoothabs
     - in fact, erfc(x/s) is probably a great smoothsign(x)
       - can we prove that x erfc(x) ~= smoothabs(x) >= 0?
