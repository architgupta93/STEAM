vecvalder-v0.012+delta-vecvalder-SVN-r40-tianshi

-- Changelog

v0.012+delta:
   - FIXME/TODO: CROSS-PRODUCT AND TEST UPDATES by Tianshi: need to document!
   - updated configure.ac to test for MATLAB and other basic programs
   - cleaned up tests (replaced soft links by copies) and fixed install
   - added log10 support
   - added rdivide.m as a soft link to mrdivide.m
   - updated inverterchain_DAEAPIv6->inverterchain_DAEAPIv6_old, run_ALL_tests
   - subsasgn fix: vv(i:j) = double
   - subsref fix: vv(:) and vv{:} access
   - majorbug fix in subsasgn - subasgn written from scratch, without
     using builtin subsasgn (which was causing big problems). Tested on
     vsrc_xgate_resistor.
   - added uniqIDs to DAEAPI calls in tests
   - updated all soft links to relative ones
   - added Parameters support to dfq_dp (test_DAEAPI_parmObj_inverterchain)
   - added make release and make snapshot

v0.012:
   - Octave 3.4.3 compatibility changes: run_ALL_tests works in Octave
     - added vecvalder.vertcat, otherwise Octave complains
     - put in code to detect Octave in run_ALL_tests and to turn off
       warnings, clear functions at the end of the script.
     - added other files like uQSS.m, about the absence of which octave
       complains.

v0.011: snapshotted on 2011/10/19
   - added make release to Makefile.in
   - changed norm(...) to norm(full(...)) in all tests (fixing Arie's problem).
   - improved quickstart help
   - fixed get(); improved der2mat to produce sparse matrices
   - cleaned up subsref code

v0.01: snapshotted on 2011/10/18
   - this is the initial snapshot with an assigned version
     number. It has been verified on a number of tests (go to
     the directory tests, start matlab and run run_ALL_tests).

     It features support for several functions and operators beyond David's
     version of early Oct, 2011; plus modifications of some of his original
     routines.

   - 2011/10/15-18: updates by JR
     - added installation via autoconf
     - 0-README-vecvalder (some basic documentation)
     - added the directory tests/ with a few basic tests
     - added subsref overloading

   - 2011/09: initial revision, David Amsallem's code
