vecvalder is a Matlab/Octave class that performs automatic differentiation
of Matlab code.

- vecvalder is built on top of @valder by Richard D. Neidinger. See:

    and MATLAB Object-Oriented Programming", SIAM Review, Vol. 52, No. 3, 
    pp. 545â€“563, 2010.

=============================================================================
-- Quickstart, step 0: installing it from source (skip this step if you are 
   using a binary release)
   - autoconf
   - ./configure [--prefix=/where/to/install/vecvalder]
     # default location is $HOME/local/pkgs/vecvalder
   - make
   - make install
   - follow the instructions at the end of make install to test

-- Quickstart, step 1: running the included tests 
   - cd ./tests/
   - matlab
     > addpath .. % ie, the directory containing @vecvalder
     > run_ALL_vecvalder_tests

-- Quickstart, step 2: using vecvalder within your own code
   - this documentation has been moved to [MAPPTOP]/help/MAPPautodiff.m

-- TODOs
   - size checks seem to be missing for all binary operators
   - overload the following operators: (see http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/matlab_oop/br02znk-1.html)
     - rdivide - currently missing
     - power - currently linked to mpower
     - we also need a matvalder class which interacts with vecvalder
       - so that valders can be in matrix entries, too - useful for parameter
         sensitivities.
     - operator= ?
     - copy constructor ?
     - length - builtin seems to work
     - size - builtin seems to work
     - vertcat - builtin seems to work
     - horzcat - builtin leads to error - this is how it should be
     - subsindex - indexing with object indices; not needed
